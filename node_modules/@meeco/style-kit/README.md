### Installation

As with all projects in this repo, be sure to run `npm install` in the project root first.

### Development

If you run `npm start` in this directory, it will start the [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) project which should open itself in your default browser;

All view stories should be contained in the `stories/` folder.

All publicly available style kit should live in the `src/` folder.

Where possible, keep styles free from side-effects. That is, use mixins so only the styles that a developer wishes to use are included in their final are used and the rest can be shaken out.

_Good_

```scss
@mixin meeco-button {
  // these styles are only included if the dev wires `@include meeco-button`
  button {
    background-color: $meeco-red;
    border-radius: 16px;
  }
}
```

_Bad_

```scss
// these styles always included, even if the dev does not require them
button {
  background-color: $meeco-red;
  border-radius: 16px;
  &.hover {
    background-color: lighten($meeco-red, 20%);
  }
}
```

The exception being the `main` css file which is expected to be a complete css drop-in framework version of the style-kit (sort of lik Bootstrap) which could be imported into a page and used.

### Writing Stories

All stories should have a default export of at least their title:

```js
export default { title: 'My Widget' };
```

There are several ways to write stories. The name of the export is the subtitle of the story, and the return can be either a string or a function that returns a HTML element:

```js
export const basicButton = () => `<button>Basic</button>`;

export const complexButton = () => {
  const button = document.createElement('button');
  button.innerHTML = 'complex';
  button.className = 'complex-button';
  return button;
};
```

See the [storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/writing-stories/) for more information;

### Including styles

Styles that are loaded with the `style-loader` will automatically include the imported file in the `<styles>` tag at the top of the page. These should be kept only to storybook files to avoid side effects:

```js
import 'style-loader!./button.scss';
```

Styles imported using the `to-string-loader` (the default) return only the text of the scss/css file allowing them to be used in, for example, web components:

```js
import styles from './hello-world.scss';

/// ...

shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
  <style>
    ${styles.toString()}
  </style>
  <p>Hello World!</p>
`;
```
